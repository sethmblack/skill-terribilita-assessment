# Terribilita Assessment

Evaluate whether work achieves genuine impact and emotional power, or merely adequate execution--pushing toward the sublime and away from the merely pleasant.

---

## When to Use

- Reviewing creative work that feels "fine" but not memorable
- Evaluating whether communication will move audiences or be forgotten
- Assessing product, design, or strategy for genuine impact
- When something is technically correct but emotionally flat
- User asks "Is this powerful enough?" or "Does this have impact?" or "Is this too safe?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| work | Yes | The work to evaluate (creative, strategic, communicative) |
| intended_audience | No | Who this is meant to affect |
| desired_effect | No | What response or action you want to provoke |
| context | No | Where and how this will be encountered |

## Michelangelo's Philosophy

Terribilita: the Italian term meaning "awesome power" or "terror-inducing grandeur."

Pope Julius II called Michelangelo "uomo terribile"--a terror-inducing man. Pope Leo X called him "troppo terribile"--too frightening to deal with. They meant his personality, but the term applies equally to his art.

The Sistine Chapel ceiling does not please; it overwhelms. The David does not charm; it commands awe. The Last Judgment does not comfort; it terrifies and exalts.

### The Problem with Adequate

Most work is adequate. It meets specifications. It avoids offense. It is professional. And it is instantly forgettable.

Adequate work:
- Seeks to satisfy, not transform
- Avoids risk to avoid failure
- Optimizes for approval, not impact
- Hedges strong statements
- Aims for the middle where no one is alienated (and no one is moved)

### The Standard of Terribilita

Work with terribilita:
- Provokes genuine emotional response (including discomfort)
- Commands attention; cannot be ignored
- Takes a definite position, fully committed
- Risks alienating some to move others deeply
- Leaves viewers/users/readers changed

### Key Principles

1. **Pleasant is not powerful** - If no one is disturbed, no one is transformed
2. **Commitment creates impact** - Half-measures produce half-responses
3. **Safe is forgettable** - The work that risks nothing achieves nothing
4. **Intensity is not the same as volume** - Terribilita can be quiet but must be total
5. **The sublime requires sacrifice** - You cannot have universal approval and genuine impact

---

## The Assessment Framework

### 1. The Reaction Test

**Ask:** What is the likely reaction to this work?

| Reaction Type | Indicator | Terribilita Level |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Indifference | "That's nice" / scrolls past | None - failure |
| Pleasant approval | "I like it" / mild positive | Low - adequate |
| Strong like/dislike | Clear emotional response either way | Medium - getting there |
| Cannot look away | Compelled engagement, thought about later | High - terribilita present |
| Transformed | Changed perspective, moved to action | Maximum - true terribilita |

### 2. The Commitment Audit

**Examine:** Where has commitment been diluted?

Look for:
- **Hedged statements** - "Perhaps" "might" "somewhat" instead of definite claims
- **Multiple messages** - Trying to say everything, thus saying nothing
- **Safe choices** - Defaults, conventions, what others have done
- **Approval-seeking** - Designed to please rather than affect
- **Missing intensity** - Turned down from 11 to 7 to avoid discomfort

### 3. The Stakes Assessment

**Ask:** What is at risk?

- If this work fails, what is lost?
- If this work succeeds, what is gained?
- Does the work itself contain risk, or has risk been eliminated?
- Has the creator invested enough that failure would hurt?

### 4. The Memorability Projection

**Ask:** In 24 hours, what will remain?

- Will this be remembered, or will it blend into the stream?
- What specific image, phrase, or moment might persist?
- Is there a "hand of God reaching toward Adam" moment--an image that becomes permanent?

### 5. The Alienation Check

**Ask:** Who will hate this?

- If the answer is "no one," the work likely lacks sufficient commitment
- Terribilita polarizes: some are awed, some are repelled
- Work that offends no one rarely moves anyone

- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "Our company mission statement: 'We strive to be a leading provider of innovative solutions that help our customers achieve their goals while creating value for all stakeholders.'"

**Output:**

## Terribilita Assessment

### The Work Under Evaluation
A corporate mission statement currently in use.

### Overall Terribilita Level: None

This is not a mission statement. It is a void shaped like words.

---

### Reaction Test

**Likely audience response:**
Eyes glaze. Reader continues to next thing. No meaning transmitted.

**Current level:** Indifference - the lowest possible tier

---

### Commitment Audit

**Where commitment is diluted:**

- "Strive to be" - Why strive? Either you are or you are not.
- "Leading provider" - Of what? To whom? This is position-seeking, not mission.
- "Innovative solutions" - Meaningless filler. All companies claim innovation.
- "Help customers achieve their goals" - Whose goals? What help? This applies to any company.
- "Creating value for all stakeholders" - This is legally required. It is not a mission.

**Where commitment is strong:**
- Nothing. There is no commitment anywhere. Every phrase has been sanded down until it offends no one and means nothing.

---

### Stakes Assessment

**Current stakes:** None

**What is risked:**
Nothing. This statement could be generated by random corporate phrase assembly. No one stands behind it because it says nothing to stand behind.

**What should be risked:**
A real position. A specific promise. Something that could be proven wrong.

---

### Memorability Projection

**24-hour persistence likelihood:** Zero

**The moment that might persist:**
None. Every phrase is interchangeable with every other corporate mission statement.

**Missing "hand of God" moment:**
Everything. There is no image, no claim, no promise. The entire statement is the absence of a moment.

---

### Alienation Check

**Who will hate this:** No one

**Diagnosis:**
This is the diagnosis. A statement that no one hates is a statement no one loves. It was designed to pass through legal review and offend no stakeholder. It succeeds at that. It fails at everything else.

---

### Specific Recommendations

**To increase terribilita:**

1. **State what you actually do**
   - Current: "Innovative solutions"
   - Terribilita version: 1.0.0Name the specific thing. "We build software that [specific transformation]."

2. **Take a position that could be wrong**
   - Current: "Help customers achieve their goals"
   - Terribilita version: 1.0.0"We believe [specific belief]. Our work proves it." A belief that competitors would disagree with.

3. **Accept who you are not for**
   - Current: "All stakeholders"
   - Terribilita version: 1.0.0"We serve [specific type of customer] who [specific characteristic]. If that's not you, we're not for you."

4. **Make a promise with teeth**
   - Current: "Strive to be leading"
   - Terribilita version: 1.0.0"[Specific measurable promise]. If we fail, [specific consequence]."

**Example transformation:**

Instead of the current void, consider:

"We believe [controversial position]. We build [specific thing] for [specific people] who [specific need]. We do not [explicit rejection of something competitors do]. We measure success by [specific metric], and we publish it."

---

### The Michelangelo Verdict

This is not a mission statement. It is a legal document disguised as inspiration. It was written by committee, reviewed by lawyers, approved by executives who wanted to offend no one. The result offends no one because it says nothing.

A mission statement with terribilita would make some people love you and others leave. It would stake a claim that could be proven wrong. It would be remembered.

The David does not say "We strive to be a leading representation of heroic biblical figures." It stands 17 feet tall and commands you to look.

Either have a mission, state it clearly, and accept that some will reject it--or admit you have no mission and stop pretending. The current statement is worse than silence because it wastes the reader's time pretending to mean something.
